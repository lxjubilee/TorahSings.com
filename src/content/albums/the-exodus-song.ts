Mosheh and the children of Yisrael stand on the far bank with the water closing behind them, and the first word out of the song is אשירה — ashirah. It is a verb. It is first person. And it is in the aspect Hebrew reserves for what has not been completed. I will sing. Before the song says anything about Yahuah, or the sea, or the horse and the rider, it announces what it is about to become.',

Instead the Song of the Sea opens forward. It does not say we sang. It does not say it is finished. It says I will sing, and it goes on saying it while it is being sung, which means the song is never quite the song yet — it is always the promise of the song, renewing itself line by line for as long as anyone keeps singing.',

    intro:
      'Every song on this album begins at the first word of the Song of the Sea: אשירה — Ashirah — stripped of pointing and cantillation and read as the five symbols it is. The table below is the disclosed layer of the method. Each letter carries a pictographic sense and a standard numerical value. The value is folded by seven onto a degree of a seven-note mode. Seven degrees. This album sings in Aeolian on A. There is a small delight waiting at the bottom of all this: the source word means, in plain Hebrew, I will sing. The song names itself before it begins.',
    steps: [
      'Strip the pointing. The vowel marks and the cantillation came later; read only the consonantal frame, as it stood when it was cut.',
      'Restore the pictograph. Each symbol carries an older sense — an ox, teeth, a hand, a head, lifted arms — that the letter has never entirely shed.',
      'Take the standard value. The numbers are not fashioned for this method; they are the ones the tradition has assigned since long before anyone listened for a scale in them.',
      'Fold by seven. Each value reduces onto a degree, one through seven. Multiples of seven rest on the seventh; nothing is discarded, nothing goes to zero.',
      'Sound the degree in the mode of the album. Until the mode receives it, a degree has no pitch. Here the mode is Aeolian on A.',
    ],
    closing:
      'The first word of the Song of the Sea is אשירה, and it means I will sing. Before the poem says anything about Yahuah, or the sea, or the horse and the rider, it says what it is about to do — the Song of the Sea names itself. Now read the symbols. The aleph, the ox, the strength standing still, sounds the tonic: A. The shin, the teeth, climbs to the sixth, F. The yod, the working hand, falls to the third, C. The resh, the head, rises to the fourth, D. And the hey — behold, breath, arms lifted — reaches the fifth, E, and there the word stops. A · F · C · D · E. It begins at home and it climbs, and it does not come home again. Rising. Unresolved. The people who first sang it were standing on the far shore of one thing and the near shore of everything else, and the letters know it. They are still crossing.',

      'What is disclosed here is enough to reproduce the note sequence. It is not enough to reproduce the song. The ordering and interleave that turn a degree sequence into melody, the rhythm and octave placement, and the voice-assignment pass that distinguishes the angelic register from the human one remain undisclosed. Serious students will find the methodology, at the disclosed level, in the downloadable resources kit included with membership.',
