      'Every song on this album begins where the text begins: with the first word of the Scriptures, בראשית — Bereshit — stripped of its vowel points and cantillation and read as the six symbols it is. The table below is the disclosed layer of the method. Each letter carries a pictographic sense and a standard numerical value. The value is folded by seven onto a degree of a seven-note mode. Seven degrees. This album sings in Ahavah Rabbah on D.',
    steps: [
      'Strip the pointing. Vowel marks and cantillation are later additions; read only the consonantal frame, as it was cut.',
      'Restore the pictograph. Each symbol carries an ancient sense — an ox, a house, a head, a mark — that predates its use as a letter.',
      'Take the standard value. The numbers are not invented for this purpose; they are the ones the tradition has always assigned.',
      'Fold by seven. Each value reduces onto a degree, one through seven. Multiples of seven rest on the seventh; nothing falls away to nothing.',
      "Sound the degree in the album's mode. The degree is not a note until a mode gives it one.",
    ],
    closing:
      'Read the sequence back and listen to where it lands: E♭ · G · D · B♭ · F♯ · D. בראשית opens on the second degree — the house (ב) does not begin on the beginning; it leans toward it, unresolved, a door left ajar. The aleph, the ox, the strength, sits at the centre on the tonic. And the final symbol, ת — the mark, the sign, the covenant cut into the doorpost — comes home. The first word of the Scriptures begins away from rest and ends at rest. The whole of the text between them is the walk from one to the other. We did not arrange that. It was there.',
    withheld:
      'What is disclosed here is enough to reproduce the note sequence. It is not enough to reproduce the song. The ordering and interleave that turn a degree sequence into melody, the rhythm and octave placement, and the voice-assignment pass that distinguishes the angelic register from the human one remain undisclosed. Serious students will find the methodology, at the disclosed level, in the downloadable resources kit included with membership.',
