The throne he sees is high and lifted up, and the hem of the robe on it does not drape; it fills the temple, the way water fills a jar. There is no measurement in the account and no architecture. A man who has spent his life describing kings walks into the room where the King is and finds that his vocabulary has been confiscated at the door.',

Two thirds of the equipment of a seraph is spent on not looking and not being seen. Only one pair does what wings are for.

    intro:
      'Every song on this album begins at the word Yeshayahu reaches for when he tries to say what he saw: כסא — kise, the throne — stripped of pointing and cantillation and read as the three symbols it is. The table below is the disclosed layer of the method. Each letter carries a pictographic sense and a standard numerical value. The value is folded by seven onto a degree of a seven-note mode. Seven degrees. This album sings in Phrygian on E, the mode with the half step at the door.',
    steps: [
      'Strip the pointing. The vowel marks and cantillation are later hands; read only the consonantal frame, cut as a scribe cut it.',
      'Restore the pictograph. Behind the letter stands the picture it came from — an open palm, a prop, an ox — and the picture still carries its sense.',
      'Take the standard value. The numbers are inherited, not assigned for this purpose; the tradition set them down long before anyone listened for a scale inside them.',
      'Fold by seven. Each value reduces onto a degree, one through seven. Multiples of seven rest on the seventh; no symbol falls away to nothing.',
      'Sound the degree in the mode of the album. A degree stays a number until a mode lends it a pitch. Here the mode is Phrygian on E.',
    ],
    closing:
      'כסא is only three symbols, and all three are doing the same thing. The kaf is the open palm — to cover, to bend, to allow — and it sounds the sixth, C, high in the mode and unsteady there. The samech is the prop, the thing that upholds and turns, and it falls to the fourth, A. And the aleph — ox, strength, the first — lands on E, the tonic, the ground of the mode. C · A · E. A descent, and not a climb. Every symbol in the word for throne is coming down, and what it comes down to is rest. The letters total eighty-one, nine upon nine. The throne is not the place where power strains upward. It is the place where power sits.',
    withheld:
      'What is disclosed here is enough to reproduce the note sequence. It is not enough to reproduce the song. The ordering and interleave that turn a degree sequence into melody, the rhythm and octave placement, and the voice-assignment pass that distinguishes the angelic register from the human one remain undisclosed. Serious students will find the methodology, at the disclosed level, in the downloadable resources kit included with membership.',
