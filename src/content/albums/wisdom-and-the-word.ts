        text: 'The eighth chapter of Proverbs is stranger than its reputation. It opens as a book of instruction and then, without warning, the instruction begins to speak in the first person. A voice comes up out of the text that is plainly not Shelomoh’s. It says it was possessed in the beginning of His way, before His works of old. It says it was set up from everlasting, from the beginning, before ever the earth was. And it says this calmly, in the middle of a chapter about not being a fool, as though the reader were expected to keep up.',

Before the deeps, before the fountains heavy with water, before the mountains had been settled and the hills brought forth, before He had made the earth or the fields or the first handful of the dust of the world. When He set a compass upon the face of the deep. When He gave to the sea His decree, that the waters should not pass His commandment. Each clause draws a line further back, and the voice is on the far side of every line, watching.',

Not the play of triviality — the play of a craftsman’s hands moving without hesitation, of a child at the feet of a parent who is working. Whatever wisdom is, the text puts it beside the compass while the circle goes down on the face of the deep, and it puts it there laughing. That is not the picture most of us carry. We imagine wisdom as gravity, as the slow careful weighing of a thing. The Scriptures locate it, first, in delight.',

Fold each by seven and sound them in Lydian on F — the mode with the raised fourth, the mode that always sounds like it is looking slightly upward — and the word does something almost none of them do. It begins at home. It has nothing to travel toward. And then it settles onto one note and simply stays, past the point where a word ought to have finished.',

  derivation: {
    intro:
      'Every song on this album begins at the word Proverbs sets before the foundations of the earth: חכמה — Chokmah — stripped of pointing and cantillation and read as the four symbols a scribe would have cut. The table below is the disclosed layer of the method. Each letter carries a pictographic sense and a standard numerical value. The value is folded by seven onto a degree of a seven-note mode. Seven degrees. This album sings in Lydian on F, the mode with the raised fourth — the one that never quite stops looking upward.',
    steps: [
      'Strip the pointing. Vowel marks and cantillation are later additions to an older frame; read the consonants alone, as they were cut.',
      'Restore the pictograph. Each symbol carries an ancient sense — a wall, an open palm, water, lifted arms — that predates its use as a letter of an alphabet.',
      'Take the standard value. These numbers are inherited. The tradition assigned them long before anyone thought to listen for a mode inside a word.',
      'Fold by seven. Each value reduces onto a degree, one through seven. Multiples of seven rest on the seventh; nothing reduces away to nothing.',
      'Sound the degree in the mode of the album. A degree is not yet a note; a mode makes it one. Here the mode is Lydian on F.',
    ],
    closing:
      'חכמה begins where most words end. The chet — the wall, the enclosure, the thing that separates and protects — sounds the tonic. F. Wisdom opens already at rest, already home, before it has said anything at all. Then the kaf bends to the sixth, D. The mem, water, the deep, falls to the fifth, C. And the hey — behold, breath, the lifted arms — comes to the fifth again and holds it. F · D · C · C. The letters total seventy-three, the standard gematria of חכמה, a number the tradition has carried for centuries. Read the shape of the thing: settled at the beginning, sustained at the end, and nowhere concluded. Wisdom does not finish its sentence. It keeps the note.',
    withheld:
      'What is disclosed here is enough to reproduce the note sequence. It is not enough to reproduce the song. The ordering and interleave that turn a degree sequence into melody, the rhythm and octave placement, and the voice-assignment pass that distinguishes the angelic register from the human one remain undisclosed. Serious students will find the methodology, at the disclosed level, in the downloadable resources kit included with membership.',
