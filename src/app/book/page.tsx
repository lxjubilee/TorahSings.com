            The albums let you hear it. This is the account of how it was found — where the first sequence turned
            up, what the symbols were doing, why the fold is sevenfold, and what else came loose from the text
            once we stopped reading it the way we had been taught to. It is the argument in full, set down for
            anyone willing to check the work. It is not offered as canon. It is offered as something to consider.
